#Function: plural() to state the position of the character you want to replace and add to the string
#use if and elif statements and return string and added conditions
#output: The plural version of the string entered to the function


#x is the string and "-1" represents the last character. I put it equal to "y" to state that if the last letter is equal to "y", then replace it and add "ies".
def plural(x):
  if x[-1]=="y":
    #excludes the last character which is "y"
    return x[:-1]+"ies"

#if the last two letters are "ch", return and add "es" to the string. It is a similar process for the next conditions.
  elif x[-2:]=="ch":
    return x+"es"
#If last letter of the string "x" (-1) is "s" return and add "es" to the string
  elif x[-1]=="s":
    return x+"es"
#anything else, return and add "s" to the string
  else:
    return x+"s"
  
    
print(plural("hurry")) # “hurries”
print(plural("patch")) # “patches”
print(plural("bus")) # “buses”
print(plural("cat")) # “cats”
