#Function: roll2(side) to generate random outputs of two six sided die
#keep list of outcomes. if something is not in the list then append it to the list. Stop the function when it has reached all 36 possibilities. 
#Use the sort function to put the outcomes in order
#Output: The unsorted and the sorted list of outcomes

#import random numbers
import random
#make a counter variable to count the number of variations until it reaches 36
#make an empty list
counter=0
my_list=[]

#make two variables to represent each dice being "rolled" and use the random function
def roll2(side):   
  dice1 = random.randint(1, side) 
  dice2 = random.randint(1, side) 
  return [dice1, dice2]

#make the length of the list 36 to show all possible outcomes when you "roll" the die
while 36>len(my_list):

#make the function into a variable to save the numbers rolled
  roll_list=roll2(6)

#if a roll is NOT already in the list then append it (add on the ones that are not included yet )
  if not (roll_list in my_list):
    my_list.append(roll_list)
#counts the amount of times rolled  
  counter+=1
 
print("You rolled the dice", counter,  "times.")
print(my_list)
print()

#print sorted version
print(sorted(my_list))
