#Forgetting a comma would cause a syntax error because it is necessary for making multiple commands when you're printing something for instance. Another is if I forget to put a parenthesis when trying to print a function, which wouldn't work. 
#A logical error can be if I didnt convert something properly and had a error in my calculations because it would be my fault, not the program's. 
#A runtime error can be if I forget to define a variable and I try to print it.
