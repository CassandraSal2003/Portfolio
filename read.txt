My final project will be showcasing the projects I have done using programming languages such as Python and Java. I will show the project either using a picture or a video of how the program works. To the side of the video or photo, I will explain why this project has significance or simply why I wanted to show it. There will be a navigation bar at the upper right hand corner. One of the projects, the TTNY hack a thon was important to me because I had never made a project on the financial aspect. This was exciting because it was a project outside of school that could potentially be used for everyday life. The other two projects were mostly just fun to make, so I wanted to include them because I am proud of my work on them.
