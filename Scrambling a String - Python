# function: scramble(), swaps 1st character with 2nd, the 3rd with 4th
#           and if off last is left as is
# input: a string input
# processsing: counts letters in string, then in for loop/range seperates the chacracters,
# if even swap, if odd then last charcter is left as is.
# output: scrambles a string by swapping the first character with the second,
#   the third character with the fourth, etc. If the string has
#   an odd number of characters, the last character is left as is.

# use string slicing
def scramble(string):
    str_length=len(string)
    x = ""
    for i in range(str_length):
    
        c=string[i]
        # hello
        # ehllo

        # true when we want to initiate a swap
        if i % 2 == 0:

            # to make sure there is a next letter to swap
            if i + 1 < len(string):
                x += string[i+1]
                x += string[i]
            else:
                x += string[i]
