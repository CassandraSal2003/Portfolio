#I asked the user to input a number , then I made variables and used the modulo and dashes to separate the digits the user put in. Then I added up the variables and printed the solution. 
# pick a random integer between 100 and 999 inclusive
num = int(input("Enter a number between 100 and 999 inclusive: "))
ones_place=num%10
tenths_place=(num//10)%10
hundreds_place=num//100

total=ones_place+tenths_place+hundreds_place

   
print("The sum of the digits is ",total, ".", sep="")
